# DMW-Naming-Convention-Project

We downloaded around 11,000 PDF files which contains election data of people in Gujarat. Then using some cool PDFBox (Java Library) features, we convert all these PDFs into text files and create a big database to query for some interesting facts like most common name in particular area of Gujarat, ratio of men to women and many more !! Generated graphs and reports. Technologies used : Java, Swing, MySQL for database.
